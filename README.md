# Oxygens Swiss Knife
**WordPress plugin for Oxygen builder that will help you optimize WordPress and speed up your workflow.**

I firstly created this plugin based on my personal needs. 

## What this plugin can do for now
1. Clean up WordPress header from
	- WP Emoji
	- Feed Links
	- WP Generator
	- Rest API
	- oEmbed Discovery Links
	- DNS Prefetch

2. Enqueue most common scripts that I use
	- jQuery instead of WP core
	- Green Sock
	- Scroll Magic
	- Parallel Scrolling
	- Smooth Scrolling
	- TreeJS

3. Enable upload file support for	
	- SVG 

## Roadmap
- Enable TTF Upload
- Include Anime.js
- Split Sections into Tabs
Scripts are downloaded true Bower and included in plugin folder or you can replace them with CDN.	
- Provide links to the included Scripts 


### Note: Scripts are enqueued only if you activate checkbox

## Settings location
After you install plugin you can find plugin setting under Settings > Swiss Knife
