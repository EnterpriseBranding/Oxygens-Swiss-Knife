# Oxygens Swiss Knife
WordPress plugin for Oxygen builder that will help you optimize WordPress and speed up your workflow.

I firstly created this plugin based on my personal needs. 

Plugin to 2 things for now:
1. Clean up WordPress header
2. Enquiry most common scripts that I use:
	- jQuery instead of WP core
	- Green Sock
	- Scroll Magic
	- Parallel Scrolling
	- Smooth Scrolling
	- TreeJS

Scripts are downloaded true Bower and included in plugin folder or you can replace them with CDN.
