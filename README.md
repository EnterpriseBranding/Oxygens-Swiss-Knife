# Oxygens Swiss Knife
**WordPress plugin for Oxygen builder that will help you optimize WordPress and speed up your workflow.**

I firstly created this plugin based on my personal needs. 

Plugin to 2 things for now:
1. Clean up WordPress header
2. Enqueue most common scripts that I use:
	- jQuery instead of WP core
	- Green Sock
	- Scroll Magic
	- Parallel Scrolling
	- Smooth Scrolling
	- TreeJS

Scripts are downloaded true Bower and included in plugin folder or you can replace them with CDN.	

### Note: Scripts are enqueued only if you activate checkbox

## Settings location
After you install plugin you can find plugin setting under Settings > Swiss Knife

## Roadmap

- Enable SVG Upload
- Enable TTF Upload
- Include Anime.js
- Split Sections into Tabs

**Would like help with and to put them under same roof:**
- Edit with Oxygen builder under page or post list
- Back to Oxygen Templates - https://wpdevdesign.com/back-to-oxygen-templates-plugin/
- Oxygen Tree Opener - https://wpdevdesign.com/oxygen-tree-opener-plugin/
